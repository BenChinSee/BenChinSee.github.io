        <br>
        <p>Lots of techniques in web development can be used to enhance viewer experience, make the application more responsive or
            create more efficient code etc...
          <br>
          One technique for reviewing code is to consistently use commenting to help other human individuals to understand
          the process of a specific piece of code. Even in web development, web designers may need to communicate with other
          developers to ensure their groupwork is inline with their criteria. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Commenting from a designer's perspective would then
          be used to remind the developer how large or where to put components on a webpage.
        </p>
        <br>
       
        <p>
          Another technique used in web development is optimizing any images within the website. Developers may want to
          consider images with low file sizes, making it quicker for visitors to load images. The worse case scenario for
          heavy-graphical websites is making it perform slow by using too many animations or pictures.<br>
          <br>
          To optimize images, you could use apps such as Photoshop to crop out, scale down or even reduce some of the image
          quality. 
          <br>

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PCWKuJEz-g">Here is a link to a video on 
            resizing images while still maintaining most of the original image's quality</a>
        </p>

      </main>
      
      <aside class="aside">
        <p>If you don't have Photoshop, you can use online services to 
            insert the '.png' or '.jpg' file onto the website to automatically compress the file to reduce the file size. 
            <br>
            It's simple and easy and it's free!
