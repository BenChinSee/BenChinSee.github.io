        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The terminology used in web development will take some time for developers, new and old, to recognise
            and utilize when explaining a particular part of the code or content. Below is a list of some of the
            jargon used in the subject.
          <br>
         
             Accessibility - Used primarily when the developer takes into account the usage of their content and how
             a different user may percieve and process information. Accessibility is a matter of designing a website while 
             considering different aspects of people who may have disabilities or users with impaired senses. Typically, low
             accessibility may make it harder for certain users to read or input information within a website.
             <br>
             <br>
             Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - This is a style sheet language which changes a web page's layout on a single
             document. Typically, this can be used to create a unique appearance to the website's look by defining the way
             the text, font, sizing and interface looks. CSS is ideal for re-using the appearance of a web page onto other pages
             of the website as they can all be linked to the same style sheet document.

             <br>
             Commenting - Within programming in general, commenting is essentially putting notes which create context for a
             particular set of code within your program. For web design, commenting is beneficial for designers as one can
             put a note about what a set of code does for their own or for someone else's reference.
             <br>
             <br>
             Element - A component used within HTML. Simple components of elements can be in the form of text, images or links.

      <aside class="aside">
        <p> Here are some other terms used within web development
          <br>
          <br>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) - A standard language used throughout the creation of webpages and web applications.
             Text editors can utilize HTML code by producing the content of a webpage, while they use CSS to produce the overall
             design of website itself.
            <br>
             HTML documents can include content other than text, such as page links to other parts of the
             website, or place media, videos or photos onto their webpage. At the current moment, HTML5 is the latest version of
             the language, offering new and more diverse technologies for web developers to take advantage of.
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
             Property - In terms of using CSS, a property illustrates the characteristic/attribute of an element. For example,
             the colour, size, font of a paragraph can be changed by stylizing those properties within CSS.
