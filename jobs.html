        <p>Having a career in web design involves creating the overall theme and look of the website. They may need to consider the intended
            audience and how they're going to enhance the user experience. While juggling these two fundamental tasks, they may work for a 
            specific client, meaning that they'd need to adapt and cater towards their needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alongside with their criteria, they're also expected to make sure
            that the website is capable of responding to different devices with different resolutions and aspect ratios.
            <br>
            <br>
          Some web developers may want to further develop their skills to create web applications and programs in a subject
          of their choosing. Compared to web designing, web development doesn't necessarily focus on how
          the website looks. 
          <br>
          The general aspect of web development is creating the functionality of the product, whether it's a webpage or
          web application.

              While both may seem similar in some cases, there's also a hybrid between the two careers. Surprisingly to most, this is referred to as
              being a webmaster. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Instead of focusing on either the appearance or the functionality of the result, a webmaster combines 
              both of these assets while ensuring that the web servers are fully operative.</p>
