      <main class="main"><h2>The main purpose of this website</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase what a typical newspaper layout-based website looks like.
        The first page of the website is called the 'landing' page (or more commonly referred to the 'home page'). 
        Throughout the website, there will be topics related to web development, specifically terminology, jobs and tutorials associated with the topic.
        
        The design of the website will maintain a 'professional', yet simplistic layout, 
        while attempting to use fonts, colour schemes and sizing, similar to that of other newspaper-based websites.
        <br>
        <br>
        On the next column, this website will explain the concept of responsiveness, making the website 'adapt' to
        the user's device (or rather their resolution). The result will make the content 'fit' onto the whole
        screen, while still keeping the content easily viewable.
      </p>

            <h3>Student, 20, responsible for upcoming design of a newspaper-style website.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              The secondary purpose of the website is to create a responsive website, making it possible to
              change the layout of the webpage when it's viewed at different resolutions. For example, the columns
              on each webpage may collapse under each other, instead of appearing side-by-side. As a result, viewer
              will be able to see all the content without having to scroll horizontally. This is especially
              useful for mobile users as it's easier to scroll vertically to view on a much smaller screen.
