        <p>Lecturers from across the UK have praised Visual Studio Code, a code editor
          for purposes such as making websites and experimenting with user interfaces.
          After being enrolled to many UK universities, students have given positive verdicts
          on the editor due to its ease of use.
          <br>
          Many students have said that it's an excellent step-up from simpler editors such as
          Notepad++, as it introduces the use of extensions, which may be used to further improve
          Visual Studio Code's ease of use. For example, one can download a 'HTML live previewer'
          making it possible for the person to reference their work against the result on the same window.

        It's better than using something like Notepad++ where you're staring at a white background in the middle
        of the night, which puts extra strain on my eyes." - Ben

        "Using Visual Studio Code does everything that I want it to do. It may seem different at first,
        but the principle is the same. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I love the way that you can use extensions to preview your code right next
        to the webpage you're working on. It's fantastic!" - Michael

        It's best feature is arguably how colours are used in Visual Studio Code, e.g. Plain text appears white (in dark mode),
        while HTML elements appear blue. You can also change the theme of the application to dark mode to prevent eye strain. - Dorian
